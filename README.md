# Ether-AI
Ether AI is a retro-terminal chatbot merging 1980s "Lavender-80" aesthetics with modern NLP. Powered by Microsoft DialoGPT and Flask, it features a minimalist splash screen and a text-heavy terminal interface. This project demonstrates AI model integration, asynchronous jQuery requests, and immersive Ubuntu Mono UI/UX design.
